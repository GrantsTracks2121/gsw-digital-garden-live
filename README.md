Maxime Vaillancourt's digital garden 
The site at Github: https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template
His walk-through: https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll
Demo of his sample site: https://digital-garden-jekyll-template.netlify.app/

I'm following the walk through at the Refined Mind here:

Having gone through the "fire swamp" hellish experience of getting Ruby and Rubygems set up on my Mac, they seem to be stable now as I learn how to use Jekyll to generate HTML pages from my Obsidian notes written in markdown.

Maxime Vaillancourt's walk-through includes how to set up Netlify to automatically publish changes made after a Github repository of my digital garden is updated from my local computer. That just isn't happening as advertised yet. We'll see if there's something I missed.
